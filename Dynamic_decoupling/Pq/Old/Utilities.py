Key modifications:
1. Remove IBMQ-specific dependencies
2. Provide minimal implementations
3. Allow easy customization

For the Pilot Quantum workflow, you can:
- Remove or stub out IBMQ-specific imports
- Use the simplified utility functions
- Focus on the core circuit cutting and dynamical decoupling logic

Would you like me to help you adapt the script to remove IBMQ dependencies completely?
